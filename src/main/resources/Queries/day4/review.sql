--find the 3th maximum salary from the employees table (do not include duplicates)

--MANUAL STEPS
-- first sort salary in desc order
select distinct salary from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY desc;
-- cut the list from line 4 to get first 3

-- use min salary to find 3 maximum

-- SOLUTION
select min(salary) from (select distinct salary

                         order by SALARY desc)
where ROWNUM<4;

-- How can we get information about that employee  (3rd max )
select * from EMPLOYEES
where SALARY=(select min(salary) from (select distinct salary
                                       from EMPLOYEES
                                       order by SALARY desc)
              where ROWNUM<4);


--find the 3rd minimum salary from the employees table (do not  include duplicates)

-- first sort salaries in asc order
select distinct salary
from EMPLOYEES
order by SALARY asc;

-- cut the list from line 4


--use max salary to find 3 maximum
select max(salary) from (select distinct salary
                         from EMPLOYEES
                         order by SALARY asc)
where ROWNUM<4;
--3rd min
elect * from EMPLOYEES
    where SALARY=(select max(salary) from (select distinct salary
                                           from EMPLOYEES
                                           order by SALARY asc)
